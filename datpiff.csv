IAmMixtapes,Joey Bada$$,Gold,sponsored,"1999 rejex"" is a compilation of tracks that didn't make it to my debut mixtape ""1999"" (obviously). I decided to put this project together because I have a lot of unreleased material that I didn't want to keep from the ears of my fans and supporters. I also have a couple of tracks on here I did when I was 15 years old (""little rachel"", ""indubitable"", and ""silent knight"") and I want to show people the progress I've made in a couple of years. The remaining songs (""flowers pt. I"", ""catharsis"", ""panty raid"", ""fantum"" and ""update"") are tracks I dropped prior to the release of '99 as promo only. I look at ""rejex"" as my more experimental side compared to '99. Putting together these two projects even taught me a lil sumchin about my evolution as an artist and individual. Watch me go from ""Joey B4 DA $$"" to the ""Joey BA DA $$""...... If you know what eye mean.. Haha

KnowledgeBornTV,"Knowledge Born, Dramatic, MindQwezt, Mucho, Young Benz, Young Knowledge, Willie Oso, Lejuan Love, Young Luck, Dj Prime Time ",Bronze,,"The Mind Of A New Breed

Every generation has their storytellers. They are MCs and lyricists who tell it like it is to evoke change in their audience. The mainstream airwaves are saturated with glorified “rappers” injecting fables of hoes, money, foreign cars, guns, drugs, and murderers. 2013 belongs to the urban revolutionaries and its televised. Following the trends set by Slick Rick, KRS-1, and Special Ed, New Breed is a collaboration presented by Knowledge Born, fellow Miami and Chicago artists.

“Bring truth to my peers” –Knowledge Born

Artist “Dramatic” delivers a soul searching introduction with “Thoughts on the Balcony” that serves as an alter call. A public service announcement to the young and fly future leaders of this generation. New Breed is the new street gospel. A collaboration of street clergymen including Dramatic, Mind Qwezt, Young Benz, Mucho, Willie Oso, DJ Primetime, Young Knowledge (Chicago, IL), Young Luck, Lejuan Love, Mistah Charlie and no other than Knowledge Born. From the real streets of Miami, Florida positioned in between Miami Dade's international airport and bridges that lead to sandy beaches, this Miami is commonly referred to as the First 48: where bullets rain worse than hail storms, avenues raise boys, and girls become mothers by age nine. New Breed is a reality check that there is an alternative route to the success other than crime: the Corporate Grind.

The warning label reads: raw, uncut, pure, and unfiltered truth. As gruesome and gritty as the lyrics are, this particular group of artists are not glorifying the struggles or the current circumstances, but bringing awareness to the potential fatalities of it. The underlying and principal tone of the music is everyone has a choice, despite what it may seem like. A hustle is a means of survival. The term hustle doesn’t only apply to slanging dope, scheming, or running from the police. But it is choosing a path of self truth, no matter how hard it maybe, New Breed gives its listeners something to hold on to.

“You don’t have to soul your sell just to get a meal fool!” – Young Benz

The fact of the matter is hip hop in it's present state cares less about the current state of the urban community, when in fact, hip hop was once an inspiring influence in the urban community. The hip hop culture fails to breath life into cities such as Miami, Chicago and other bullet riddled, drug and crime infested regions. It encourages our youth (and those confined to their destructive ways) to an early grave. However, just when all faith was lost, New Breed declares life and offers lyrical mentorship.

“Hammers go to ringing, angels go start to singing, only means you have to face your demons” -Mucho

New Breed is a testimonial of artists that have made a conscious decision to change their surroundings through their music versus allowing their surroundings to change them. It’s apparent that they have seen their fair share of the “Hard Knock Life.” When others live day by day assuming it’s the end, the artists of New Breed have awakened and made a premeditated decision to awaken others.

New Breed is a timeless blend of poetic lyrics, street bangers, and hood memoirs.

theimmortalfame,"Kayden Crooks, M.O.S.E, CDN Birdman, The MC I Isaiah Phinn, Dakk One, Kniggz, Dekoy, WildCard, ALilCraze",Bronze,sponsored,"1994 is far from perfect.. Its Raw, Its Real, Its 1994.

May 11, Vancouver, B.C.- Rapper Kayden Crooks dropped a bomb on the hip-hop community today. Over the last year Crooks has surreptitiously been working on a collaborative mix tape featuring some of Canada’s biggest names in underground hip-hop. Crooks rapped on and mixed the ‘90s inspired mixtape, entitled 1994, which features WildCard (Abbotsford, BC), M.O.S.E (Langley, BC) , Kniggz (Saskatchewan), Dakk One (Vancouver, BC), CDN Birdman (Langley, BC), Dekoy (Saskatchewan), and The MC Isaiah Phinn (Toronto, ON). The beats were produced by J Dilla except for Real Real which was produced by Jake One.
Crooks might be shy about his hip-hop heritage (his uncle is a Grammy winning rapper) but he’s not afraid to show his influences. In Crooks’ words, “My goal was to bring back that ‘90s type rap that people say they miss and wish it would come back.” In the words of Chin Injeti, ""rap is not supposed to be perfect”. 1994 is far from the over-produced, auto-tuned rap of today. The goal for 1994 was to showcase Crooks’ raw talent. 
1994 is Crooks’ second release under the moniker. The first being Written Violations Vol.1 released in 2013. He also had a release under the Immortal Fame name, 2012’s Fames Kitchen. 1994 is available for free download online at datpiff.com; http://www.datpiff.com/Kayden-Crooks-1994-mixtape.610399.html or on Soundcloud.com;  https://soundcloud.com/kaydencrooks/sets/1994-mixtape .

Lovari says of his new project, ""The

about my experiences helped me get through personal tough times. I'm singing about issues that many would prefer to keep to themselves.""

Lovari was featured on the front cover of the June 2012 issue of ""Get Out Magazine"" and preceded his album release with performances at Jacob Javits Center. The
album's preview single/video ""Foolish Beat"" was infamously featured on PerezHilton.Com and the lead single ""Keep It Movin'"" (feat. Loco

JohnPaulEnt,John Paul,Bronze,sponsored,"South Florida's up and coming hip hop sensation, John Paul, releases new album appropriately titled, ""Now or Never"". This project solidifies John Paul's presence in the South Florida music scene. 

The explosiveness contained in the title track, Muthafuckin Right (lead by a Notorious BIG sample), displays John Paul's aggression and fury at it's peak. 

Lead by its two singles “Rap on Radio” and “Down Low”, John Paul hooked up with the highly praised Florida producer Goldru$h for the “Now or Never” project. Goldru$h’s credits include Trick Daddy (including the single “Bet That”), DJ Khaled, Lil Wayne, Plies, Young Jeezy, Waka Flocka, Ace Hood, Pimp C and more.

The duo of John Paul and Goldru$h set out to complete a project with a true hip-hop sound, one with a cohesive sound and feel, a feat only accomplished when a duo wraps up a whole project together. Goldru$h can also be heard on two tracks, “City Life” and “Smoking my Marijuana.”

Already looking ahead to his next project, John Paul is currently working with Lu Diaz, one half of the music production team the Diaz Brothers based out of Miami, Florida. The Diaz Brothers are well known for being largely credited for international star Pitbull’s rise to fame.",25891,,9669,0,13,100,02/27/2012,Now Or Never,11,60973

With banging beats, and a delivery filled with raw energy, this artist is sure to amaze you.
31 songs, every one of them is filled with passion and a hunger that comes across like an emcee with a mission.

French-ee makes it look and sound easy even though we all know it's not.
Watch for the soon to be released video for the smash hit, “Psycho Lady”.

Quebosky,Quebo,Bronze,sponsored,"The purpose behind the “Purple” mixtape is the capture a shade of one’s self in a musical portrait. The shade of purple when interpreted through emotion often blends struggle and beauty, as well as ignorance and bliss as in example the great novel by Alice Walker and motion picture starring Whoopi Goldberg.  The pinnacle of vitality. In this respect, Quebo expresses through the tracks a sense of purple in eventual variety. From the deep rooted essence tied into the story based on the title track, you find tracks that’s seem almost “everyday life” such as “Feeling Just fine” amplifying the experience of stardom, to the excellently performed “Smooth Sh!t”  which gives a straight forward glimpse into ignorance and heavy drug dependency, all while boasting the promise of wisdom amongst happy mischief.  Beyond this relation to the fan, the mixtape carries a since of direction atop the chaos some tracks throw you into. The Sweet symphony accomplished within “LLL” an inspirational ballad that takes the listener to church at times within its verses. Sweet, seductive and cunning are words fans associate with slow songs on the “Purple” mixtape such as “Hurt” & “For Ya”, which amazingly steps into the personal feelings of the artist as he confronts his own realities and frustrations. A truly human album for the true human listener, delicately sewn together by Quebo and legendary features such as Kuntry Boy Telly  of Platnum Playaz, Business of YNTRE, Skull Bruthaz’s Mrs. Perfect and Trey Songz to name a few. A true RnB delight for any type of listener with optimistic, powerful and vibrant lyricism.

Kokane aka Mr. Kane

     Kokane, also known as Jerry B. Long, Jr. is considered to be ""The Most Featured Artist In The World"" was born 1969, he is a rapper from Pomona, California best known for being signed & co-writing for Eazy E's “Ruthless Records” label, for his co-appearances on Dr. Dre's album 2001, the work on G-funk album Funk Upon A Rhyme and his heavy collaboration with Snoop Dogg on the Tha Last Meal album & eventually signing to Snoop's “Dogghouse” record label, bringing a renewed sense of promise to Kokane's long-running career. He is the son of Motown composer ""Jerry Long, Sr."". He started his career at Eazy-E's Ruthless Records, co-writing songs for N.W.A and Above the Law. He released his first solo album under the name ""Who Am I?"". He signed with Koch Records, forming a new group, The Hood Mob, led by him, joined by Cricet and Contraband. They released The Hood Mob album on July 3, 2006.
     Kokane's first release, Addictive Hip Hop Muzick in 1991 was credited as ""Who Am I?"". Though Kokane had been involved with the West Coast rap scene since the dawn of gangsta rap, Kokane's life has always included music, though it is the old school funk of the 1970s that most influences his style. His eccentric vocal approach is half fluid rapping and half weird P-funk-influenced singing. He began his career as a vocalist in the mid-1980s as rap was first appearing in his native Los Angeles before eventually signing to Eazy-E's Ruthless Records label in 1991. In his second album, Funk Upon a Rhyme, he completely changed his style, incorporating a great deal of singing and packin' it with G Funk. Two years later, Kokane was a free agent. He left Ruthless right after Eazy-E death. He has worked with artists such as Above The Law, N.W.A., Eazy-E, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Tha Eastsidaz, Cypress Hill, E-40, Nipsey Hussle, P Diddy, Busta Rhymes, among others. He continues to make music today and still contributes to the West Coast rap scene. Currently Jerry B. Long aka Kokane (Owner/CEO) has his own independent record label called Bud E Boy Entertainment distribution through IODA/SONY a (full service record label), along with his wife Alicia Long (Vice President) & Mr. E (CEO). Bud E Boy Entertainment staff also includes: Arnold White(A&R/Management/Marketing), DJ King Assassin (A&R/Marketing), Najee Long “Nafro Pro” (Art & Design), Rick Ross (Production/Art/Design). Bud E Boy label has R&B artist such as his daughter Aanisah C. Long aka ACL Da Boss, Pop artist,Rap, Rock & more. Kokane's current “Hot New Project “The Legend Continues"" is available now everywhere. Stay tuned for more exciting upcoming & projects from Kokane & his record label!",29261,Dj King Assassin,3703,0,8,88,06/02/2012,Dr. Kokastein,14,117769

IAmMixtapes,Tony Dufresne,Bronze,sponsored,"Tone burst onto the underground hip hop scene with a series of monthly mixtapes throughout the entire year of 2010, culminating in a nomination for Pittsburgh’s “Best Underground Artist of the Year,” and he hasn’t looked back.  He has maintained a furious release schedule since 2011 (ten projects) without sacrificing quality in the least.  His most recent project, Pittsburgh UGK (Underground King), has received critical acclaim and well-deserved respect from other significant underground artists.

Tony Dufresne is the blue collar, hip hop traditionalist’s dream artist.  You won’t find him in a music video bragging about things he doesn’t have.  Instead, you’re more likely to find him locked in a studio recording, speaking about his daily struggles and journey.  And whether it’s through an intricate verse or an intelligent hook gliding over a beat, Tone’s message promises to go straight from your ears to your heart.  Because he bases his music solely off of life experience, with no concern for doing big numbers, there is an authenticity in him that you simply cannot buy.

kodakpink,FUTURE,Bronze,,"Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn (born November 20, 1983), known professionally by his stage name Future, is an American hip hop recording artist. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, Wilburn first became involved in music as part of the Dungeon Family collective, where he received the nickname ""the Future."" After amassing a series of mixtapes between 2010 and 2011, Future signed a major-label deal with Epic Records and A1 Recordings, which helped launch Future's own label imprint, Freebandz. He subsequently released his debut album Pluto in April 2012 to positive reviews. His second album Honest was released in April 2014, where it surpassed his debut on the album charts.
Between 2014 and early 2015, Future released a series of well-received mixtapes, including Monster (2014) and 56 Nights (2015). He followed later in the year with his third studio album DS2 and the full-length Drake collaboration What a Time to Be Alive, both of which debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200. Future premiered his fourth solo album EVOL, in February 2016. Future has also released several singles certified gold or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), including ""Turn On the Lights"", ""Move That Dope"", ""Fuck Up Some Commas"", ""Where Ya At"", ""Jumpman"" and ""Low Life"".

BROWN CAESAR,Immortal Technique,Silver,sponsored,"The Martyr 
by Immortal Technique on Friday, July 8, 2011 at 12:21pm // Someone told me I was mean today. No I'm not mean. I'm just surrounded by Rebel Armz members who have a code of honor, by family who doesn't lie to me. And so, I developed a low tolerance for bullshit. I will cancel a woman who plays herself in half truths, I will strike down a man who stands in the way my goals and I will painstakingly devote my time to a cause others think is lost because I believe in it. 

Those of you close to me, you know. I am my father's son. And if that doesn't give you some idea of how much I don't fuck around then nothing will homie. I constantly try to give my time when I can but I get a million messages here I can't answer all of them, please don't harass my staff. I get lots of @ImmortalTech questions on twitter. I'm not specifically ignoring you when I don't respond. I value all causes and struggles, but the moment someone tells me that I'm not a real Revolutionary because I stop everything I'm doing and abandon the projects (both musical and human rights) to come work for you...you lose my respect. Grow up and act like a fuckin' man. This life we live is about sacrifices, about hard work and discipline. If anything being in my proximity you will notice why I get results, because I have no qualms about putting my heart and soul into something. Hip Hop is ONE of those things. While others desert her, and leave her to the culture vultures with reckless abandon, I will not. While some think the Palestinian cause lost, I do not. While others see the immigration fight as an impossible mountain to climb I do not. Some think because a few Black celebrities are paraded around in the media and we have Obama in office that this country isn't still a very racist place. But racism isn't the main problem, I've always said the feudal system never died, it just evolved into this modern caste system. A system that will feed on you until it's G checked. 

Just remember though activists, rappers, allies. I don't cut blank checks. And if you ask me I tell you the story of you and your people in way that will enlighten and hurt you, not purposefully, but I will give you the complete truth. The good and the bad. If you become angry at me for this, then you should be angry at yourself. You're the one who asked for the truth. I didn't create it. I just showed you where to look for it. If it didn't mix well with what you thought the world was blame mommy and daddy & your peers for sheltering you, lying to you or for not being there to educate you. I learn from my friends, from my Rebel Army soldiers, from my oldest friends like Cary, Ray, Vish, D. I learn from my family that which I give all I ever made too. 

So when it comes to music. I love my people and I will not leave them now in their darkest hour. Neither will my friends who are brave warriors and are willing to bleed for this. Rank and file we will out you from your comfortable spot and take the war to you, as you have taken it to our culture and our music for all these years. Our truce is done. Our peace is finished. Our war has begun.

DJJeffDuran,Future,Silver,,"Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn (born November 20, 1983),better known by his stage name Future, is an American hip hop recording artist from Atlanta, Georgia. After amassing a series of mixtapes between 2010 and 2011, Future signed a major-label deal with Epic Records and A1 Recordings, which helped launch Future's own label imprint, Freebandz. He subsequently began working on his debut album Pluto, and in April 2012 released the album to positive reviews. The album spawned five singles, all of which charted on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Future unexpectedly released his third album, DS2, in July 2015, which earned him his first number one placement on the Billboard 200 chart. His 2015 collaborative effort with Drake, titled What a Time to Be Alive, earned Future his second number one album. Future premiered his fourth solo album Evol, in February 2016, on DJ Khaled's We The Best Radio's debut on Beats 1. In 2016, Future became the fastest artist to chart three number one albums on the Billboard 200.",62062,JD,293673,0,852,92,02/24/2016,Unreleased,50,599881

The past few months have seen the Gary-raised rapper regrouping & taking control of the direction of his career, making it his task to make sure that people knew his name & skills. At this point and after the Miseducation…tape, I think it’s safe to say he has the listening ear of many and the potential to gain even more fans.

MrFeatured,Various Artists,Bronze,exclusive,"Orlando Jones never ceases to surprise. In celebration of Halloween, the actor has releasesd his first mixtape, Sleepy Holloween Vol. 1.

He collaborates with his DriveBy Entertainment partner, writer/producer Noam Dromi to create a 20-song project laced with relationship-heavy songs and interludes incorporating audio from the FOX TV series, Sleepy Hollow, which Jones stars in as Captain Frank Irving.

""Sonically, we're trying to tell a love story set against the backdrop of the war between good and evil. Whether you're a fan of Sleepy Hollow or new to the show, the range of songs will offer something for everyone,” Jones said.

Sleepy Holloween Vol. 1 features a diverse cast of guest appearances such as 2 Pac, Talib Kweli, Wicked Worlock, Tri Star, Mani Strings, Novel and Leanna James.

Rapfiend95,Lil Herb & Lil Bibby,Gold,,"These two Chiraq emcees (rhyme together a good amount of the time) started heating up in 2013 then announced their Welcome To Fazoland (Herb) and Free Crack (Bibby) mixtapes (OUT NOW!!), which were both to be quarterbacked by producer DJ L. But as fall came and went, no mixtapes arrived. Then winter passed — still nothing. Now we're kicking Rap scene's door down, and these two are finally putting the finishing touches on their proper debuts. 

But over the course of the past year, these two have continuously dropped solid material. A track here a video there — they've always stayed in the market — we just never got the mixtapes. Well, FSD joined forces with DJ L to put together this compilation, The Best Of Herb & Bibby: Heir Apparents, featuring all of their released heat in the same place at the same damn time. Some Mp3s weren't available, some links were dead, some were featured on other artists mixtapes — but the best of the best are all here.

Curious to know why the likes of Drake and Joey IE are tweeting about these two? Well, stream/download this refresher course below. Production is handled primarily by DJ L, but DJ Kenn and TVSH also show up to contribute. Lil Reese, Fredo Santana, Capo (GBE), King Louie, YP and Tink aid and assist on the feature tip. There are 30 heaters here plus 1 bonus instrumental for your listening pleasure. You can thank us later. -- @LilHerbie_Ebk @LilBibby_ @ThaKidDJL via @fakeshoredrive.",131079,FakeShoreDrive.com,332762,0,529,95,05/04/2013,The Best Of Lil Herb & Lil Bibby: Heir Apparents,31,795711
Digiwaxx,August Alsina,Gold,sponsored,"After months of viral videos, covers, and leaks, ‘The Product’ finally arrived for free download! 19-year old New Orleans native August Alsina released his DJ Scream-assisted debut mixtape, much to the delight of his Twitter and Facebook supporters. The Sunday, 4/15 release date is one of personal significance to August. It’s the birthday of his late brother who was gunned down in New Orleans in 2010. “Dedicated to my big brother. R.I.P. Melvin LaBranch III, 4.15.86 – 8.31.10”, appears on the mixtape’s back cover. The release is a fitting dedication to the brother who inspired August to leave the street life behind and make music his fulltime hustle.

Confirmed features on ‘The Product’ are Houston’s Trae Tha Truth, G.O.O.D. Music’s CyHi The Prynce, Atlanta’s own 2Win, and New Orleans female MC 3D Na’tee. August even managed to get the endorsement of New Orleans legend Juvenile, who appears on the tape to stamp young up and comer. Some early standout tracks from ‘The Product’ are the Hot Boyz/Drake cover “Ode to My Project Chicks” produced by The Exclusives, the anti-love song “Sucka”, produced by Sound Mob, and the D. Clax produced “Bad Muthaf*cka”.",131310,DJ Scream,142018,1,360,94,04/22/2012,The Product,15,549540

a promotional mixtape created while the two were touring Africa and promoting
Jay's ""The Diary of Jay-Z: Water for Life"" conquest to aid African countries in
the pursuit of clean water. That mixtape never materialized, and the hip-hop
world was left waiting for that elusive Hova v. Evil Genius collaboration.

After years of cutting demo tracks with his mentors, the Bass Brothers, at their Ferndale, MI. studio (dubbed ""The Bassmint""), Eminem was ready to release his debut album. The album was written and recorded in 1995. At the time the album was first conceived, Eminem had been using the stage name M&M. However, he changed his stage name after the release of his first official single, in early 1995. Infinite marks the debut of the name ""Eminem."" The album was only released on cassette and vinyl. Only 1,000 cassettes and 100 vinyls were made. Eminem himself, and old friends from around the time Infinite was recorded, have claimed the laid-back and humble nature of the album is due to Eminem purposely making ""radio-friendly"" songs in hopes of getting on the air of Detroit's leading Hip Hop radio station, WJLB-98. Bootlegged compact-disc copies are commonly found on sites such as eBay. The song ""Backstabber"" is a re-cut version of a song called ""Fuckin' Backstabber"", which is featured on a demo tape by Soul Intent.",81823,"Justin Comiskey, Jeff & Mark Bass Denaun Porter Slim DJ Head",114945,0,871,98,03/09/2009,(1996) Infinite,11,424993

‘Indigoism’ marks the first Brainfeeder/Underachievers collaboration. Dropping February 1st, the 17-track mixtape features the duo’s underground hits (including ‘Gold Soul Theory,’ ‘Herb Shuttles’ and ‘Leopard Shepherd’), in addition to brand new tracks produced by the likes of Mr Bristol, Rich Flyer, The Entreproducers, Bruce Lee Kixxs, Juice and Lou Chapo from Tribe Gang, and Dreamrite. Listening to their sage lyrics, it’s hard to believe they’re only 21 (Ak) and 22 (Issa Dash) years old. And on the strength of ‘Indigoism,’ it’s near impossible to believe that up until 9 months ago, Ak and Dash had no set intention to be in the rap game at all.

Also, I couldn't include the original song 'Nike Boot' because it's on itunes but you can get a taste of the beat/hook in the song ""The Cliche Lil' Wayne Feature"" which is basically a remix of Nike Boots.

I appreciate you giving me the time I needed to grow, experiment, and find the direction for my 2nd album.. And I have.
Along the way I’ve recorded at least 4 albums worth of material, lots of it being unfinished demo versions waiting to be polished up, some of them are great songs and important stories that just won’t make the album (either they don’t fit Sonically, don’t fit Theme, or there’s just not enough space) .

Tonight, I want to give you a few of these songs because you deserve them. It’s hard as fuck for me to keep all this music from you for so long, so I know it’s been hard for you to wait. Thank you for your patience. Vibe out to these songs in their raw form, no polish.. just a lot of my soul..
