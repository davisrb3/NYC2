Datpiff Web Scraper to get data on celebrated mixtapes

The really simple Read Me:

1. Run the scraper
2. Play around in the R file to get the charts

Note: R file currently adds missing data for very highly downloaded mixtapes manually, based on the most recent day I ran the scraper, this could be more robust.

Future improvements:
- Scrape ALL mixtapes on datpiff, including those with <25000 downloads, (appox 530,000 as of October 1, 2020)
- Further exploration in popularity of listens vs downloads over time
- Datpiff has mostly moved to a mobile application, and the way the website and app interplay would be important
- Lots of formatting on charts, and add code to print them out to new files as needed
